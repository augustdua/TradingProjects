## Overview

The **Trading Strategy Backtesting Framework** is built to facilitate the systematic testing and optimization of trading strategies using historical market data. By leveraging Python's powerful data analysis libraries, the framework provides a seamless experience for strategy development, parameter tuning, backtesting, and performance evaluation.

---

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Easily add or modify trading strategies without altering the core framework.
- **Dynamic Strategy Selection**: Choose from multiple predefined strategies or implement your own.
- **Data Integration**: Fetch historical stock data from Yahoo Finance seamlessly.
- **Parameter Optimization**: Automatically find the best parameters for your strategy using optimization techniques.
- **Backtesting Engine**: Simulate strategy performance over historical data to evaluate profitability and risk.
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculate essential metrics like Profit, Hit Ratio, Sharpe Ratio, Maximum Drawdown, and more.
- **Volume Confirmation**: Enhance strategies with volume-based filters to validate breakout signals.
- **Visualization Tools**: Plot price movements, breakout levels, and signals for intuitive analysis.
- **Error Handling**: Robust mechanisms to handle data inconsistencies and runtime errors.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Pip** (Python package installer)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/trading-strategy-backtesting.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd trading-strategy-backtesting
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required Python libraries using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Directory Structure**

   Ensure your project directory is structured as follows:

   ```plaintext
   trading-strategy-backtesting/
   │
   ├── backtesting/                  # Backtesting and performance modules
   │   ├── backtest_engine.py
   │   ├── performance.py
   │
   ├── data/                         # Stock data fetching and preparation
   │   ├── fetch_data.py
   │
   ├── strategies/                   # Strategy implementations
   │   ├── break_out_strategy.py
   │   ├── mean_reverting_strategy.py
   │   ├── moving_average_strategy.py
   │
   ├── main.py                       # Main script to run the framework
   ├── requirements.txt              # Python dependencies
   ├── README.md                     # Project documentation
   ```

## Usage

### 1. Running the Framework

To start the backtesting process:

```bash
python main.py
```

**Workflow:**

1. **Select a Strategy**: The framework lists available strategies. Input the number corresponding to your chosen strategy.
2. **Fetch Stock Data**: The framework fetches historical data for the selected stock ticker.
3. **Optimize Parameters**: It automatically finds the best parameters for the strategy based on historical performance.
4. **Generate Signals**: Buy and sell signals are generated based on the strategy's logic.
5. **Backtest**: The strategy is backtested over the historical data to simulate performance.
6. **Save Results**: Backtest results are saved to a CSV file for further analysis.
7. **Evaluate Performance**: Key performance metrics are calculated and displayed.

### 2. Selecting a Strategy

Upon running `main.py`, you will see a list of available strategies:

```plaintext
Available Strategies:
1. break_out
2. mean_reverting_strategy
3. moving_average

Select a strategy by number: 1

You selected: break_out
```

Enter the number corresponding to the strategy you wish to test.

### 3. Adding a New Strategy

To add a new trading strategy:

1. **Create a New Strategy File**

   In the `strategies/` directory, create a new Python file, e.g., `my_new_strategy.py`.

2. **Implement Required Functions**

   Each strategy should implement the following functions:

   - `generate_signals(data, breakout_window, confirmation_window, ticker)`: Generate buy/sell signals based on strategy logic.
   - `optimize_strategy(data, breakout_window_range, confirmation_window_range, ticker)`: Optimize strategy parameters.
   - `get_best_params(data, ticker)`: Wrapper to get the best parameters.
   - `filter_params_for_function(best_params, func)`: Filter parameters for function compatibility.
   - `visualize_results(data, ticker, title)`: (Optional) Visualize strategy results.

3. **Run the Framework**

   The new strategy will appear in the list when you run `main.py`.

## Strategies

### 1. Breakout Strategy

**Objective**: Identify and capitalize on significant price movements beyond recent high or low levels, confirmed by trading volume.

### 2. Mean Reverting Strategy

**Objective**: Exploit price movements that deviate significantly from the mean, assuming they will revert back.

### 3. Moving Average Strategy

**Objective**: Generate buy and sell signals based on the crossover of short-term and long-term moving averages.

## Backtesting Engine

The **Backtesting Engine** simulates the performance of a trading strategy using historical data. It evaluates how the strategy would have performed in the past, providing insights into its potential future performance.
